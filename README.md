Simon Says Game

Description

The Simon Says Game is a memory-based game where players must repeat an increasingly long sequence of colors. The game starts with a simple pattern and progressively becomes more challenging as the sequence grows. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features

Randomly generated color sequences.

Visual and interactive feedback using animations.

Dynamic difficulty that increases with each round.

Popup help menu explaining the rules.

Error handling to prevent premature clicks during sequence playback.

How to Play:

Click the START button to begin.

Watch the sequence of colors displayed.

Click the colors in the same order as they appeared.

If you get the sequence right, the next round starts with an additional color.

If you click the wrong color, the game ends.
